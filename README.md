Development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to accurately classify plastic waste images. This project leverages deep learning techniques to support efficient waste segregation and recycling processes, promoting sustainability and environmental conservation through advanced image-based plastic waste identification.
# Plastic Waste Classification Using CNN

## Description
This project aims to develop a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to classify images of plastic waste into distinct categories. The goal is to use deep learning techniques to identify and categorize plastic waste effectively, contributing to waste management and environmental sustainability.

The dataset used in this project is **extensive** and contains a large number of high-resolution images of various types of plastic waste. This ensures the model can generalize well to real-world scenarios but requires significant computational resources to process.

## Dataset
The dataset is a key component of this project and consists of a **large collection of labeled images** of plastic waste. It is designed to train deep learning models efficiently and support scalability for real-world applications.

Due to its size, the dataset is hosted externally and can be accessed using the link below:

## Current Progress
## Visualization
The **visualization** part of the project has been completed. We analyzed the dataset to understand the distribution of:
- **Organic Waste**
- **Recyclable Waste**
At this stage, the project is focused on:
1. Preparing and uploading the large dataset for use.
2. Ensuring the dataset is well-organized and accessible for training the CNN model.
3. Future work includes building and training the CNN model on this dataset to achieve accurate classifications.
